First attempt to make a .NET Core Web API 

This project is based on Microsoft's tutorial:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio

As I finish this tutorial, I would like to extend the following project with:
	-PostgreSQL database instead of In Memory;
	-Simple database schema with more entities;
	-User login session;
